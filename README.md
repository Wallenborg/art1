The thing's hollow -- it goes on forever -- and -- oh my God! -- it's full of pixels!
(Niklas Wallenborg. Webpage, 2023)
This work is a interactive webpage. That showcases an endless stream of tiny, colorful squares (pixels) 
scattered across the screen in a dynamic and unpredictable manner. The artwork utilizes a combination of randomness and meticulous design, 
generating an ever-changing display of ten-pixel-sized boxes. Each box appears at a different position on the screen, 
forming an awe-inspiring tapestry of colors that seemingly stretches into eternity.
